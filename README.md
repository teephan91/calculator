## About
This is an on-screen calculator, with four basic math operators plus a decimal point button. If users make a mistake, they can delete any digit or simply start fresh, which will erase all the memory. Users can turn on/off the calculator as they wish. They provide the input by clicking on the buttons or from their favorite keyboard.

## What I Did
This one was a cornerstone project because it was the final project of [the Odin's Project Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations). It meant I had to utilize all the web development knowledge that I'd learned over the last four months to get it done.

And yes, it was quite hard, especially the Javascript portion of it. The problem with building a calculator is that there are a variery of scenarios of how a user might input their numbers. For example, a user can input a number, then they decide to delete a few digits and add a decimal point somewhere in the mix. I had to think through these scenarios and made my program work for each. Another difficulty was to add keyboard support to the calculator. The keyboard eventListener had to match the mouse eventListener which took me a while to figure out and connect the two of them.

Apart from the JS side of things, HTML & CSS were *easier*. I did have some hiccups here and there with CSS for when I tried to create an up & down animation for my buttons. But overall, I had fun making my calculator look good. I really loved the colorway and I even named it the TP-2022.
